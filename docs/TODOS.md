## Tenants

It would be nice to support tenants where we use the 1/default tenant.

## Full server sessions

It would be nice to fill the fields which are not templates in the xml server session by real values, or have explanations about what is their purpose.

## Use a proper xml escaping function

Currently we use a handmade escape xml function, it would be better to have a tested one.
